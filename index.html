	        <p>As an undergraduate student with seemingly <abbr title="Not really but close enough">infinite</abbr> taps of energy, I prefer to spend that time fiddling with whatever I can, hoping to stumble upon inspiration for my next <abbr title="Or small, but still useful">big</abbr> creation.
	        </p>
	        <p>This website, for example, was really only made so I could teach myself web development, one of the only aspects of programming I never sat down to try. In the first three days, I realized that the surely convoluted <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags were very intuitive and easy to learn.
